            Our story starts with a man who wondered about a better way. In
            2007, Stuart Lombard made a personal goal to reduce his
            environmental footprint. After discovering that heating and cooling
            make up 40% to 60% of home energy use, he attempted to program his
            own thermostat to conserve energy while away on vacation. When he
            and his family returned home to Toronto to a shockingly cold house,
            he began to envision a better efficiency solution that could
            conserve energy without compromising comfort. Assembling a small
            team of likeminded experts, the new Canadian company of ecobee was
            formed. Together, the ecobee team was able to launch the first ever
            smart thermostat. Since then, ecobee customers across North America
            have saved more than 27.8 TWh of energy, which is the annual
            equivalent of saving enough energy to take all the homes in Los
            Angeles and Chicago off the grid for a year. And that impact
            continues to grow every day.
